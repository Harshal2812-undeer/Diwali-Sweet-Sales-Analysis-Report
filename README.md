# Diwali-Sweet-Sales-Analysis-Report

This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of a sweet shop during the Diwali festival. The analysis is performed using Python and the Pandas library for data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by visualizations created with Power BI.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the raw sales data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as needed.

2. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Explore the cleaned dataset and derive insights related to sales performance, popular sweets, and sales trends across different shop locations.

3. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations using Power BI to present the analysis findings in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/diwali-sweet-shop-sales-analysis.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install pandas`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the `DiwaliSalesAnalysis.ipynb` file in your Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The `DiwaliSalesAnalysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data cleaning and preprocessing. Here are the main steps:

1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Remove any duplicate rows from the data.
3. Handle missing values by dropping rows with missing data.
4. Convert data types of relevant columns to ensure consistency.
5. Generate a cleaned dataset file (`cleaned_diwali_sweet_shop_sales.csv`) for further analysis.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis and visualization were performed using Power BI. The `Diwali Sweet Sales Analysis Report.pdf` file contains the final report with interactive visualizations and insights. Some key visualizations include:

- Sum of Total Sales by Sweet
- Sum of Total Sales by Shop Location and Sweet
- Count of Shop Locations by Sweet
- Sum of Total Sales by Shop Location and Shop Name
- Vendor's Average Margin
